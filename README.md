# Truco Paulista

Have you ever played truco paulista? Well, if you are from SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil probably so. If you don't, that will be a good opportunity once you are familiar with the rules ðŸ˜‰.

I had this crazy idea to implement this game in Elixir then I could practice my architecture skills and of course play with Elixir/Erlang OTP processes. However, my main goal here is to have fun throughout this development and try out new things.
